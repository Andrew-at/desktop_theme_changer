# desktop_changer_ub
This is going to be a desktop/wallpaper changer for Ubuntu distro of Linux.
Ideally what I would like it to do is use an API from the National Weather Service to change the wallpaper to reflect what the current weather is.
EG: rainy themed wallpaper for rain, sunny for sun, ect.
